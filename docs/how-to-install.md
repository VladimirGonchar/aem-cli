## Installation 

This project is delivered in two ways:

1. As npm package from [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aem-cli)
- install NodeJS
- `npm install aem-cli -g` - to install AEM CLI globally
- `aem --help` - to verify installation

2. As Docker image with pre-installed AEM CLI from [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vhonchar/aem-cli)
- install Docker
- use `FROM vhonchar/aem-cli` in your Dockerfile

Actually, Docker way does the same things as the first option of installation.
